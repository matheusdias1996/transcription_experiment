# Real Transcription Testing Guide

This guide provides steps to test the real-time transcription functionality with your physical microphone.

## Testing Real-Time Transcription

### 1. Start Recording

- Click the "Start Recording" button in the application
- Allow microphone access if prompted
- Speak clearly into your microphone

### 2. Observe Real-Time Transcription

As you speak, you should see your words appear in the transcription box. The transcription is updated in real-time as audio chunks are processed.

### 3. Verify Transcription Quality

- Check that the transcription accurately reflects what you said
- Confirm that you don't see the "You you you" issue that was previously occurring
- Note that longer, more complex sentences may take slightly longer to transcribe

### 4. Stop Recording

- Click the "Stop Recording" button when you're done
- The final transcription should remain in the transcription box

### 5. Test Question Answering

- Type a question related to your transcription in the question box
- Click the "Ask" button
- Observe the answer generated based on your transcription

## Testing Different Speech Patterns

To thoroughly test the transcription functionality, try the following:

1. **Short phrases**: Speak short, simple phrases and verify they're transcribed correctly
2. **Long sentences**: Speak longer, more complex sentences to test the system's ability to handle continuous speech
3. **Different speeds**: Try speaking at different speeds to see how it affects transcription accuracy
4. **Pauses**: Include natural pauses in your speech to test how the system handles breaks
5. **Technical terms**: Include some technical or uncommon words to test the system's vocabulary

## Expected Behavior

- The transcription should update in chunks as you speak
- There should be no "You you you" artifacts in the transcription
- The transcription should be reasonably accurate, though not perfect
- The question answering functionality should provide relevant responses based on your transcription

## Comparing with Previous Behavior

If you were experiencing the "You you you" issue before, you should notice that:

1. The transcription now shows actual words instead of repeated "You"
2. The audio chunks are being properly buffered to ensure they're long enough for accurate transcription
3. The MediaRecorder is using a 2000ms timeslice instead of the previous 1000ms
